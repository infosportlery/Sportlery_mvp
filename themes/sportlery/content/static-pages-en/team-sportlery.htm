          <p> Sportlery is an online platform where sports enthusiasts can meet, to play and organise games together, and easily book a sport location.');?>  The first the idea for Sportlery crossed our mindss, was during the summerbreak of 2016, when we felt like we wanted to go out and sport, but no one was available and we could not find the right location.'); ?>  So we decided that there should be a solution for this, and we created Sportlery!'); ?></p>
          <br>
          <p> Sportlery creates the opportunity of finding another sports enthusiast around you, with the same intrest and level in sports as you do. Together you decide where and when you practice your sport. You could also create your own sporting event'); ?>  Furthermore, Sporlery facilitates all kinds of sportlocation in your neighbourhood. As well commercial sportclubs as public fields, indoor or outdoor, we got it all.'); ?></p>

          <br>
          <p> While finishing off his Bachelor at Hotelschool The Hague, he decided that a ‘regular’ internship was not the right thing to do. His entrepreneurial mind triggered him to start his own business.  His ability to communicate creates a host of opportunities and allows our team to coordinate itself like an oiled machine, which results in a more effective and efficient working pace. In his free time, he loves to play hockey.'); ?></p>
